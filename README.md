## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.

### Developer notes

If you're contributing or setting up the project locally, we recommend using nvm (nvm-windows on Windows) to manage Node versions. The project is verified with Node v20.19.4 ‚Äî some native packages require this minimum. Example (Windows PowerShell with nvm-windows):

```powershell
# install (if needed) and use the matching Node version
nvm install 20.19.4
nvm use 20.19.4
node -v
```

When installing dependencies, use the legacy peer deps flag to avoid peer resolution errors encountered with newer npm defaults:

```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

These steps will reduce EBADENGINE warnings and help ensure native modules like Skia install cleanly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd NutriAI
   ```
3. Install the required NPM packages. If you encounter peer dependency issues, you may need to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
   ```sh
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Create your `.env` from the template
   ```sh
   # macOS/Linux
   cp env.example .env
   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env`
   - Expo public vars must be prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
   - Prefer using a backend proxy for AI calls instead of embedding secrets
   - See `env.example` for placeholders (AI, Firebase/AWS, feature flags)

### FatSecret Integration (Recipes)

We use FatSecret as the primary external recipe/food provider. To keep credentials secure, the app requests a short‚Äëlived OAuth2 access token from a Supabase Edge Function instead of storing secrets client‚Äëside.

1. Create the token broker function

   The repository includes `supabase/functions/fatsecret-token/index.ts`. Deploy it to your Supabase project and set two function secrets:

   - `FATSECRET_CLIENT_ID`
   - `FATSECRET_CLIENT_SECRET`

   Deploy (PowerShell):

   ```powershell
   supabase functions deploy fatsecret-token --project-ref <PROJECT_REF>
   ```

2. Configure client environment

   In your `.env`, set the public token URL so the app can request an access token:

   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FATSECRET_TOKEN_URL=https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/functions/v1/fatsecret-token
   ```

   Do NOT set `FATSECRET_CLIENT_ID` or `FATSECRET_CLIENT_SECRET` in the client. Keep them only in Supabase Function secrets.

3. Run the app

   ```powershell
   npm run start
   ```
   npx expo start --tunnel

   The Recipes ‚Üí Discover tab will load results via FatSecret. If the function or secrets are missing, discovery will show an empty state and log an error in the console.

## üß≠ Milestone: Supabase Backend & AI Proxy

We have integrated Supabase as the backend with a dedicated `nutriai` schema (strict RLS) and deployed an `ai-chat` Edge Function that securely proxies AI calls.

What this enables:
- Secure AI calls without exposing provider keys in the app
- Per-user data isolation via RLS on `nutriai.*` tables
- Easy backend evolution (models, rate limits, validation) without shipping new app builds

### Supabase (Nosh) configuration
- Project URL: `https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co`
- Schema: `nutriai`
- Tables: `profiles`, `inventory_items`, `shopping_list_items`, `meal_plans`, `recipes_saved`, `ai_messages`
- Edge Function: `ai-chat` (JWT verification enabled)

### Client environment (Expo)
Add to `.env` (client-safe):
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_ANON_KEY>

# Optional informational values (no secrets)
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b:free
```

### Server secrets (Supabase ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí ai-chat ‚Üí Secrets)
- `AI_API_KEY` = your provider key (e.g., OpenRouter)
- `AI_API_BASE` = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
- `AI_MODEL` = openai/gpt-oss-20b:free

### üß© Ingredient Icon Generation (Edge Functions)

Generate simple black‚Äëand‚Äëwhite outline icons for ingredients and store the images in S3 (preferred) or Supabase Storage.

__Schema & Functions__
- Schema/table: `nutriai.ingredient_icons` (see `supabase/sql/20250822_ingredient_icons.sql` for DDL, indexes, RLS, triggers).
- Edge Functions:
  - `get-ingredient-icon` ‚Äî enqueue/poll helper used by the app to create or fetch the latest icon by `slug`.
  - `generate-ingredient-icon` ‚Äî worker that processes rows with `status = 'pending'`, generates the PNG, uploads, and updates the row to `ready`.

__Functions Environment (set in Supabase ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Environment variables)__
- Provider selection
  - `ICON_PROVIDER` = `stability` (default) | `modelslab`
  - Stability: `STABILITY_API_KEY`
  - Modelslab: `MODELSLAB_API_KEY`, `MODELSLAB_MODEL_ID` (e.g., `imagen-3`), optional `MODELSLAB_ENDPOINT` (default `https://modelslab.com/api/v7/images/text-to-image`)
- Storage (pick one)
  - S3: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `ICON_S3_BUCKET`, optional `ICON_S3_PUBLIC_BASE`, `ICON_S3_USE_PUBLIC_READ=true`
  - Supabase Storage fallback: optional `ICON_BUCKET` (default `ingredient-icons`)
- Optional: `ICON_MODEL` (for bookkeeping; e.g., `stable-image-core` or `imagen-3`)
- Prompt versioning: `ICON_PROMPT_VERSION` (default `2`) ‚Äî bump to force regeneration with stricter prompt (transparent background; no text, numbers, UI frames/bars)

__Deploy__
```powershell
supabase functions deploy generate-ingredient-icon --project-ref <PROJECT_REF>
supabase functions deploy get-ingredient-icon --project-ref <PROJECT_REF>
```

__Test (PowerShell)__
```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
$BASE = "https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co"
$ANON = "<ANON_JWT>"
$SERVICE = "<SERVICE_JWT>"
$Slug = "yellow-onion"

# 1) Enqueue (anon)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$BASE/functions/v1/get-ingredient-icon?slug=$Slug&display_name=Yellow%20Onion" `
  -Headers @{ apikey=$ANON; Authorization="Bearer $ANON" } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

# 2) Run worker (service)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$BASE/functions/v1/generate-ingredient-icon" `
  -Headers @{ apikey=$SERVICE; Authorization="Bearer $SERVICE" } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Start-Sleep -Seconds 3

# 3) Poll (anon)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$BASE/functions/v1/get-ingredient-icon?slug=$Slug" `
  -Headers @{ apikey=$ANON; Authorization="Bearer $ANON" } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

# 4) Inspect last_error (service)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get `
  -Uri "$BASE/rest/v1/ingredient_icons?slug=eq.$Slug&select=slug,status,fail_count,last_error,updated_at&order=updated_at.desc&limit=1" `
  -Headers @{ apikey=$SERVICE; Authorization="Bearer $SERVICE"; "Accept-Profile"="nutriai"; "Content-Profile"="nutriai" } |
  ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

__Troubleshooting__
- ‚ÄúMissing STABILITY_API_KEY‚Äù ‚Üí set Functions env and redeploy.
- ‚ÄúModelslab response missing image output ‚Ä¶ subscription ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí choose a model allowed by your plan or switch `ICON_PROVIDER` back to `stability`.
- S3 `AccessDenied`/`NoSuchBucket` ‚Üí verify bucket, region, credentials; optionally set `ICON_S3_PUBLIC_BASE`.
- `processed: 0` after POST ‚Üí no rows with `status='pending'`; reset row to pending and retry.

### Test the ai-chat Edge Function
PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
$ANON = "<YOUR_ANON_KEY>"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $ANON"; apikey = $ANON; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }
$body = @{ messages = @(@{ role = "user"; content = "Give me a healthy dinner idea." }) } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri "https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-chat" -Headers $headers -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
```

### Frontend usage
- Use `utils/supabaseClient.ts` to access Supabase.
- Call `utils/aiClient.ts: aiChat(messages)` to get structured JSON for the chat/coach UI.

### Security notes
- Do not put AI keys in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` env vars. Keep them as Supabase Function secrets.
- RLS is enabled on all tables‚Äîreads/writes require an authenticated user.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```
   Or 
   ```sh
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
   to connect via a tunnel (often more reliable on restricted networks):

2. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

3. **Getting Started with Nosh**:
   - **Add Inventory**: Start by adding items to your inventory using manual entry, barcode scanning, or camera capture
   - **Plan Meals**: Open the Coach tab and use the + buttons on each meal row, or ask the coach to "Plan my day/week"
   - **Explore Recipes**: Browse and see availability based on your inventory
   - **Generate Shopping Lists**: Create smart lists from your plan and missing ingredients

### ‚úÖ Testing the Onboarding Flow

The onboarding experience is integrated with routing and persistence. If onboarding is not completed, the app automatically routes to `app/(onboarding)/`.

1. Start the app
   ```powershell
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
   Scan the QR with Expo Go on your device.

2. Walk through the steps
   - Welcome ‚Üí Health Goals ‚Üí Basic Profile ‚Üí Dietary Preferences ‚Üí Pantry Setup ‚Üí AI Coach Intro ‚Üí Completion
   - Progress is persisted locally. You can close/reopen the app and resume.

3. Complete onboarding
   - On the final screen, pick an auth option (Sign up/Sign in/Guest) and tap "Start Tracking!".
   - Your profile is mapped and saved, and onboarding is marked completed.

4. Reset onboarding for testing (developer-only)
   - In `.env`, set:
     ```env
     EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_RESET_ONBOARDING=true
     ```
     Then restart the dev server.
   - A small "Reset onboarding (dev)" link appears on the completion screen. Tap it to clear onboarding storage and restart the flow (reload the app afterward).

Troubleshooting:
- If you completed onboarding but want to see it again without the dev link, you can also clear app storage from your device settings (Expo Go) or reinstall Expo Go.
