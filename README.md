- Full-screen preview before saving, with inline editing of title/description/ingredients/steps
- "Improve with AI" button to refine parsed content (deterministic, user-controlled)
- Save actions: "Save" and "Save & Add to Folder" (with folder selection)
- Smart follow-ups: "Add to Plan", "Add missing ingredients"
- Centralized, versioned prompts with deterministic AI (temperature=0, top_p=0)
- Strict policies: conservative | verbatim | enrich; default is conservative (no guessing)
- Abstain logic on insufficient evidence (video thresholds: ‚â•70% for ingredients/steps)
- Telemetry for provenance: policy, support rates, evidence sizes, abstain reasons

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd NutriAI
   ```
3. Install the required NPM packages. If you encounter peer dependency issues, you may need to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
   ```sh
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Create your `.env` from the template
   ```sh
   # macOS/Linux
   cp env.example .env
   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env`
   - Expo public vars must be prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
   - Prefer using a backend proxy for AI calls instead of embedding secrets
   - See `env.example` for placeholders (AI, Firebase/AWS, feature flags)
   - For recipes, NutriAI now defaults to TheMealDB provider. Add:
     ```env
     # TheMealDB uses a free public key '1' by default
     EXPO_PUBLIC_MEALDB_API_KEY=1
     # Optional (usually not needed for TheMealDB, but available for web CORS workarounds)
     EXPO_PUBLIC_RECIPES_PROXY_BASE=

## üç≥ Recipe Import Pipeline (Prompts, Policies, Abstain, Telemetry)

NutriAI standardizes all import flows (text, image, video, URL JSON‚ÄëLD, reconciliation) through a centralized prompt registry and deterministic AI settings.

- __Centralized Prompts__: `utils/promptRegistry.ts` generates system prompts with versioning and per‚Äëflow policies.
- __Deterministic AI__: `utils/aiClient.ts:createChatCompletionDeterministic()` uses temperature=0, top_p=0 for reproducible outputs.
- __Policies__:
  - __conservative__ (default): No hallucinations or invention. Only evidence‚Äësupported items.
  - __verbatim__: Map JSON‚ÄëLD/Open Graph exactly to our schema. No enrichment.
  - __enrich__: Allows AI to enhance if explicitly enabled.
- __Abstain Logic__: If evidence is insufficient, the importer returns an "abstain" outcome instead of guessing.
  - For video/shorts, import requires ‚â•0.7 support for both ingredients and steps.
- __Reconciliation__: A final AI pass can remove unsupported items and annotate notes.
- __Telemetry__: `utils/importTelemetry.ts` keeps a ring buffer of recent abstains, and provenance includes:
  - `policy`, `extractionMethod`, `supportRates` (ingredient, step)
  - `evidenceSizes` (caption/transcript/ocr) and `confidence`

### UI: ImportRecipeModal

- Paste a URL or text, or attach an image/video.
- If a social video URL is detected, use "Transcribe Video" for best results.
- If a video file is attached, a "Transcribe Attached Video" button is shown.
- Preview modal supports inline editing and an optional "Improve with AI" step powered by `utils/aiRecipeParser.ts`.
- Save options include "Save" and "Save & Add to Folder"; the latter opens the folder picker.
- Preview shows provenance badges (policy, extraction method, confidence, support, evidence sizes).
- Dev helper: "View Telemetry" reveals full provenance JSON and recent abstain events (for debugging/audit).

### Environment Variables (Import Pipeline)

Add to `.env` (client‚Äësafe):

```env
# Centralized import policy. One of: conservative | verbatim | enrich
EXPO_PUBLIC_IMPORT_POLICY=conservative

# Allow AI enrichment during import (false recommended for reliability)
EXPO_PUBLIC_IMPORT_ALLOW_ENRICH=false

# Evidence thresholds for video/shorts imports (0.0 - 1.0)
EXPO_PUBLIC_IMPORT_MIN_ING_SUPPORT=0.7
EXPO_PUBLIC_IMPORT_MIN_STEP_SUPPORT=0.7

# Telemetry level (basic|verbose). Verbose logs evidence sizes & support rates
EXPO_PUBLIC_IMPORT_TELEMETRY=basic
```

### Security

- Avoid placing provider secrets in `EXPO_PUBLIC_‚Ä¶` variables for production. Route AI/STT via a backend proxy (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions) and store secrets there.
- If you previously added `EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_API_KEY` for local testing, rotate the key and remove it from the client build before shipping.
     ```

### Recipe Providers

- __Default: TheMealDB__
  - Free, no signup required. Test key `'1'` works out of the box.
  - Env: `EXPO_PUBLIC_MEALDB_API_KEY` (use `1` unless you have a Patreon key).
  - The app initializes the recipe provider with TheMealDB automatically in `components/RecipeProviderInitializer.tsx`.
- __Other providers (legacy support)__: Spoonacular, Edamam
  - Kept for compatibility but not used by default. You may adapt `RecipeProviderInitializer.tsx` to initialize a different provider if desired.

Notes:
- The web proxy `EXPO_PUBLIC_RECIPES_PROXY_BASE` is supported for CORS-only scenarios on web. Native apps (iOS/Android) call providers directly.

### üì∑ Dataset-backed Recipes (S3 Images)

If you use a local dataset (e.g., Epicurious CSV + images), you can host the images on S3 and point the app to HTTPS URLs.

__Assumptions__
- Table: `public.recipes`
- Columns: `image_path` holds the base filename (no extension), `image_url` is what the UI reads, optional `image` as a staging column
- Bucket: `nutriai-recipe-images-prod`

__Populate S3 HTTPS URLs into `image`__
```sql
alter table public.recipes add column if not exists image text;

update public.recipes
set image = 'https://nutriai-recipe-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/' || image_path || '.jpg'
where image_path is not null
  and (image is null or image = '');
```

__Make the UI use S3 immediately (copy to `image_url`)__
```sql
update public.recipes
set image_url = image
where image is not null;
```

__Optional: Switch to a CDN later (CloudFront)__
Only do this after your CDN domain works in the browser for a sample image.
```sql
update public.recipes
set image_url = replace(
  image_url,
  'https://nutriai-recipe-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/',
  'https://YOUR_CDN_DOMAIN/'
)
where image_url like 'https://nutriai-recipe-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/%';
```

__Rollback (if images stop appearing)__
```sql
update public.recipes
set image_url = 'https://nutriai-recipe-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/' || image_path || '.jpg'
where image_path is not null;
```

__CDN Checklist__
- Origin ‚Üí S3 bucket `nutriai-recipe-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com`
- Private bucket: set up OAC (Origin Access Control) and bucket policy to allow CloudFront
- Behavior: allow GET/HEAD; caching/compression on
- Test: `https://YOUR_CDN_DOMAIN/<image_path>.jpg` returns 200

__Troubleshooting__
- 403/404 on CDN: origin or bucket policy misconfigured, or propagation not complete (allow 5‚Äì15 min)
- Wrong domain in SQL: verify the exact prefix you replaced
- Content-Type: S3 objects should have `image/jpeg`

### Recipe Store Architecture

- The recipes feature shares a single store via `hooks/useRecipeStore.ts` using a React Context provider: `RecipeStoreProvider`.
- The app root wraps the tree with `RecipeStoreProvider` in `app/_layout.tsx` so all recipe components use the same instance.
- `components/RecipeProviderInitializer.tsx` is mounted in `app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx` to initialize the provider (defaults to TheMealDB) and warm trending recipes on first load.

## üß≠ Milestone: Supabase Backend & AI Proxy

We have integrated Supabase as the backend with a dedicated `nutriai` schema (strict RLS) and deployed an `ai-chat` Edge Function that securely proxies AI calls.

What this enables:
- Secure AI calls without exposing provider keys in the app
- Per-user data isolation via RLS on `nutriai.*` tables
- Easy backend evolution (models, rate limits, validation) without shipping new app builds

### Supabase (Nourish) configuration
- Project URL: `https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co`
- Schema: `nutriai`
- Tables: `profiles`, `inventory_items`, `shopping_list_items`, `meal_plans`, `recipes_saved`, `ai_messages`
- Edge Function: `ai-chat` (JWT verification enabled)

### Client environment (Expo)
Add to `.env` (client-safe):
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_ANON_KEY>

# Optional informational values (no secrets)
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b:free
```

### Server secrets (Supabase ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí ai-chat ‚Üí Secrets)
- `AI_API_KEY` = your provider key (e.g., OpenRouter)
- `AI_API_BASE` = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
- `AI_MODEL` = openai/gpt-oss-20b:free

### Test the ai-chat Edge Function
PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
$ANON = "<YOUR_ANON_KEY>"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $ANON"; apikey = $ANON; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }
$body = @{ messages = @(@{ role = "user"; content = "Give me a healthy dinner idea." }) } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri "https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-chat" -Headers $headers -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
```

### Frontend usage
- Use `utils/supabaseClient.ts` to access Supabase.
- Call `utils/aiClient.ts: aiChat(messages)` to get structured JSON for the chat/coach UI.

### Security notes
- Do not put AI keys in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` env vars. Keep them as Supabase Function secrets.
- RLS is enabled on all tables‚Äîreads/writes require an authenticated user.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```
   Or to connect via a tunnel (often more reliable on restricted networks):
   ```sh
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

2. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

3. **Getting Started with NutriAI**:
   - **Add Inventory**: Start by adding items to your inventory using manual entry, barcode scanning, or camera capture
   - **Plan Meals**: Open the Coach tab and use the + buttons on each meal row, or ask the coach to "Plan my day/week"
   - **Explore Recipes**: Browse and see availability based on your inventory
   - **Generate Shopping Lists**: Create smart lists from your plan and missing ingredients

## üéØ Key Workflows

### Adding Inventory Items
1. Tap the "+" button in the Inventory tab
2. Choose your preferred input method (manual, barcode, camera, or voice)
3. Fill in item details including expiration date and category
4. Items automatically appear in your organized inventory

### Planning Meals (Coach Dashboard)
1. Go to the Coach tab
2. Use the left/right arrows to pick a day
3. Tap + on Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snack, select a recipe and servings
4. Or ask the coach: "Plan my day" or "Plan my week"
5. Your plan updates automatically and informs the Shopping List

### Smart Shopping
1. Plan your meals for the week
2. From any recipe page, tap "Add missing (N)" in the action bar to send missing ingredients to the Shopping List
3. Review or auto-generate your Shopping List from planned meals and missing ingredients
4. Check off items as you shop; marking as purchased prompts expiry and transfers to Inventory
