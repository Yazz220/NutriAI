## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd NutriAI
   ```
3. Install the required NPM packages. If you encounter peer dependency issues, you may need to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
   ```sh
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Create your `.env` from the template
   ```sh
   # macOS/Linux
   cp env.example .env
   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env`
   - Expo public vars must be prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
   - Prefer using a backend proxy for AI calls instead of embedding secrets
   - See `env.example` for placeholders (AI, Firebase/AWS, feature flags)

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```
   Or to connect via a tunnel (often more reliable on restricted networks):
   ```sh
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

2. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

3. **Getting Started with NutriAI**:
   - **Add Inventory**: Start by adding items to your inventory using manual entry, barcode scanning, or camera capture
   - **Plan Meals**: Use the Recipes tab toggle to switch to Planner and schedule your week
   - **Explore Recipes**: Browse and see availability based on your inventory
   - **Generate Shopping Lists**: Create smart lists from your plan and missing ingredients

## üéØ Key Workflows

### Adding Inventory Items
1. Tap the "+" button in the Inventory tab
2. Choose your preferred input method (manual, barcode, camera, or voice)
3. Fill in item details including expiration date and category
4. Items automatically appear in your organized inventory

### Planning Meals (in Recipes)
1. Go to the Recipes tab and switch to the "Planner" toggle
2. Tap any day in the weekly view and select meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
3. Add recipes from your library or AI Picks
4. Your plan updates automatically and informs the Shopping List

### Smart Shopping
1. Plan your meals for the week
2. Review or auto-generate your Shopping List from missing ingredients
3. Check off items as you shop; marking as purchased prompts expiry and transfers to Inventory

## üì± App Structure

NutriAI uses a 4-tab layout focused on core nutrition workflows:

1. **Inventory** ‚Äî Item management and expiry tracking
2. **Recipes** ‚Äî Library + Planner (toggle at top)
3. **Shopping List** ‚Äî Grocery management and checkout to Inventory
4. **Nutrition Dashboard** ‚Äî Macros, goals, and proactive insights
