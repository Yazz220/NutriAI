## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd NutriAI
   ```
3. Install the required NPM packages. If you encounter peer dependency issues, you may need to use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
   ```sh
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Create your `.env` from the template
   ```sh
   # macOS/Linux
   cp env.example .env
   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env`
   - Expo public vars must be prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
   - Prefer using a backend proxy for AI calls instead of embedding secrets
   - See `env.example` for placeholders (AI, Firebase/AWS, feature flags)
   - For recipes, NutriAI now defaults to TheMealDB provider. Add:
     ```env
     # TheMealDB uses a free public key '1' by default
     EXPO_PUBLIC_MEALDB_API_KEY=1
     # Optional (usually not needed for TheMealDB, but available for web CORS workarounds)
     EXPO_PUBLIC_RECIPES_PROXY_BASE=
     ```

### Recipe Providers

- __Default: TheMealDB__
  - Free, no signup required. Test key `'1'` works out of the box.
  - Env: `EXPO_PUBLIC_MEALDB_API_KEY` (use `1` unless you have a Patreon key).
  - The app initializes the recipe provider with TheMealDB automatically in `components/RecipeProviderInitializer.tsx`.
- __Other providers (legacy support)__: Spoonacular, Edamam
  - Kept for compatibility but not used by default. You may adapt `RecipeProviderInitializer.tsx` to initialize a different provider if desired.

Notes:
- The web proxy `EXPO_PUBLIC_RECIPES_PROXY_BASE` is supported for CORS-only scenarios on web. Native apps (iOS/Android) call providers directly.

### Recipe Store Architecture

- The recipes feature shares a single store via `hooks/useRecipeStore.ts` using a React Context provider: `RecipeStoreProvider`.
- The app root wraps the tree with `RecipeStoreProvider` in `app/_layout.tsx` so all recipe components use the same instance.
- `components/RecipeProviderInitializer.tsx` is mounted in `app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx` to initialize the provider (defaults to TheMealDB) and warm trending recipes on first load.

## üß≠ Milestone: Supabase Backend & AI Proxy

We have integrated Supabase as the backend with a dedicated `nutriai` schema (strict RLS) and deployed an `ai-chat` Edge Function that securely proxies AI calls.

What this enables:
- Secure AI calls without exposing provider keys in the app
- Per-user data isolation via RLS on `nutriai.*` tables
- Easy backend evolution (models, rate limits, validation) without shipping new app builds

### Supabase (Nourish) configuration
- Project URL: `https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co`
- Schema: `nutriai`
- Tables: `profiles`, `inventory_items`, `shopping_list_items`, `meal_plans`, `recipes_saved`, `ai_messages`
- Edge Function: `ai-chat` (JWT verification enabled)

### Client environment (Expo)
Add to `.env` (client-safe):
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_ANON_KEY>

# Optional informational values (no secrets)
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b:free
```

### Server secrets (Supabase ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí ai-chat ‚Üí Secrets)
- `AI_API_KEY` = your provider key (e.g., OpenRouter)
- `AI_API_BASE` = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
- `AI_MODEL` = openai/gpt-oss-20b:free

### Test the ai-chat Edge Function
PowerShell (Windows):
```powershell
$ANON = "<YOUR_ANON_KEY>"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $ANON"; apikey = $ANON; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }
$body = @{ messages = @(@{ role = "user"; content = "Give me a healthy dinner idea." }) } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST -Uri "https://wckohtwftlwhyldnfpbz.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-chat" -Headers $headers -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8
```

### Frontend usage
- Use `utils/supabaseClient.ts` to access Supabase.
- Call `utils/aiClient.ts: aiChat(messages)` to get structured JSON for the chat/coach UI.

### Security notes
- Do not put AI keys in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` env vars. Keep them as Supabase Function secrets.
- RLS is enabled on all tables‚Äîreads/writes require an authenticated user.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```
   Or to connect via a tunnel (often more reliable on restricted networks):
   ```sh
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

2. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

3. **Getting Started with NutriAI**:
   - **Add Inventory**: Start by adding items to your inventory using manual entry, barcode scanning, or camera capture
   - **Plan Meals**: Use the Recipes tab toggle to switch to Planner and schedule your week
   - **Explore Recipes**: Browse and see availability based on your inventory
   - **Generate Shopping Lists**: Create smart lists from your plan and missing ingredients

## üéØ Key Workflows

### Adding Inventory Items
1. Tap the "+" button in the Inventory tab
2. Choose your preferred input method (manual, barcode, camera, or voice)
3. Fill in item details including expiration date and category
4. Items automatically appear in your organized inventory

### Planning Meals (in Recipes)
1. Go to the Recipes tab and switch to the "Planner" toggle
2. Tap any day in the weekly view and select meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
3. Add recipes from your library or AI Picks
4. Your plan updates automatically and informs the Shopping List

### Smart Shopping
1. Plan your meals for the week
2. Review or auto-generate your Shopping List from missing ingredients
3. Check off items as you shop; marking as purchased prompts expiry and transfers to Inventory

## üì± App Structure

NutriAI uses a 4-tab layout focused on core nutrition workflows:

1. **Inventory** ‚Äî Item management and expiry tracking
2. **Recipes** ‚Äî Library + Planner (toggle at top)
3. **Shopping List** ‚Äî Grocery management and checkout to Inventory
4. **Nutrition Dashboard** ‚Äî Macros, goals, and proactive insights
