## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review the removal list** - Verify each file is truly unused
2. **Backup before deletion** - Current commit `25f9a7fad` is safe rollback point
3. **Delete files manually** - Use the lists above
4. **Run TypeScript check** - `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no broken imports
5. **Test the app** - Ensure all features work after cleanup
6. **Commit cleanup** - Create a clean commit with removed files

- Video import feature was never fully implemented (docs reference it but no code exists)
- Jest configuration can be removed since all test files are deleted
- The codebase is now production-ready with minimal technical debt
