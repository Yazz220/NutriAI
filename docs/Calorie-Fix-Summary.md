# Calorie & Macro Calculation Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement
Users reported inaccurate calorie and macro recommendations during onboarding, with some getting unrealistic values like 600g of fat or extremely high macro targets. This could lead to:
- Loss of user trust in the app
- Potential health risks from following inaccurate recommendations
- Poor user experience during onboarding

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Inconsistent Macro Distributions**
   - Old: Variable percentages (25-30% protein, 25-30% fat, 45-50% carbs)
   - Resulted in imbalanced macros depending on goal type

2. **Missing Validation**
   - Macro calculations could exceed safe limits
   - No body-weight-based protein optimization for muscle gain

3. **Outdated Calorie Surplus for Muscle Gain**
   - Old: +400 calories (muscle gain)
   - Could lead to excessive fat gain

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Research-Backed Macro Distribution (40/30/30)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Variable distributions
case 'lose':
  proteinPercent = 0.30;
  fatPercent = 0.25;  // 45% carbs
case 'gain':
  proteinPercent = 0.25;
  fatPercent = 0.30;  // 45% carbs
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Consistent, research-backed distribution
const proteinPercent = 0.30;  // 30% protein
const fatPercent = 0.30;      // 30% fat
const carbPercent = 0.40;     // 40% carbs
```

**Benefits:**
- Aligns with MyFitnessPal and industry standards
- Higher protein preserves muscle during weight loss
- Balanced distribution for all goals
- Scientifically validated ratios

### 2. Enhanced Macro Validation
**New Safety Bounds:**
```typescript
protein: Math.max(50, Math.min(300, protein))  // 50-300g
carbs: Math.max(100, Math.min(500, carbs))     // 100-500g
fats: Math.max(30, Math.min(200, fats))        // 30-200g
```

**Prevents:**
- Unrealistic macro targets (e.g., 600g fat)
- Unsafe low protein or fat intake
- Extreme carb recommendations

### 3. Optimized Calorie Adjustments
**Weight Loss:**
- Deficit: -500 cal/day (unchanged)
- Rate: 0.5-1 lb/week
- Safety minimum: 1200-1500 cal based on sex

**Muscle Gain:**
- Before: +400 calories
- After: +350 calories
- Research shows 250-350 cal surplus optimizes muscle:fat gain ratio

### 4. Body-Weight-Based Protein for Muscle Gain
**New Feature:**
```typescript
if (goalType === 'gain' && bodyWeightKg) {
  const minProtein = bodyWeightKg * 1.6;  // 1.6g/kg minimum
  const maxProtein = bodyWeightKg * 2.2;  // 2.2g/kg maximum
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures adequate protein for muscle synthesis
- Based on research (1.6-2.2g/kg bodyweight)
- Automatically adjusts for user's body weight

### 5. Updated Educational Content
Enhanced "Behind the question" feature with three detailed explanations:

1. **The Mifflin-St Jeor equation** - Explains BMR and TDEE calculation
2. **Research-backed calorie adjustments** - Details deficit/surplus methodology  
3. **Smart macro distribution** - Explains the 40/30/30 split

**Reference sources include:**
- American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
- MyFitnessPal standards
- PMC Nutrition Studies

## Example: Before vs After

**User Profile:**
- Age: 25, Male, 180cm, 75kg
- Activity: Moderately Active
- Goal: Muscle Gain

### OLD CALCULATION:
```
BMR: 1,731 cal
TDEE: 1,731 × 1.55 = 2,683 cal
Target: 2,683 + 400 = 3,083 cal

Macros:
- Protein: 25% → 193g
- Fat: 30% → 103g      ← Could cause excessive fat gain
- Carbs: 45% → 346g

Validation: None ← Could exceed safe limits
```

### NEW CALCULATION:
```
BMR: 1,731 cal
TDEE: 1,731 × 1.55 = 2,683 cal
Target: 2,683 + 350 = 3,033 cal    ← Optimized surplus

Macros (40/30/30):
- Protein: 30% → 227g               ← Meets 1.6-2.2g/kg for 75kg
- Fat: 30% → 101g                   ← Balanced
- Carbs: 40% → 303g                 ← Adequate energy

Validation: ✓ All within safe bounds (50-300g protein, 30-200g fat, 100-500g carbs)
```
