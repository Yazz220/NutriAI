**Safety-Critical Features:**
- ✅ Allergen tracking and validation
- ✅ Dietary restriction enforcement (vegan, halal, gluten-free, etc.)
- ✅ Health concerns awareness
- ✅ `containsAllergen()` - checks if ingredients contain user allergens
- ✅ `violatesDietaryRestriction()` - validates against dietary rules

**Personalization Features:**

- ✅ Max cooking time preferences
- ✅ Health goals and custom motivations
- ✅ Activity level and demographics

**Prompt Generation:**

---

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Nutrition Coach** ✓

#### **2. Coach Context Builder** (`utils/coach/contextBuilder.ts`)
**New Function:** `buildEnhancedCoachSystemPrompt()`

**What It Does:**
```
Original Prompt (9 lines):
- Basic Nosh rules
- Today's calories/macros
- 7-day summary

Enhanced Prompt (30-50 lines):
+ 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY RULES (allergies, dietary restrictions)
+ 📊 Today's nutrition progress
+ ❤️ USER PREFERENCES (cuisines, dislikes, cooking time)
+ 🎯 USER'S HEALTH JOURNEY (goals, motivation, activity level)
```

**Example Enhanced Output:**
```
CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:
🚨 CRITICAL: User is allergic to: peanuts, shellfish
   → NEVER recommend foods containing these allergens
🚨 DIETARY RESTRICTION: Vegan
   → No animal products whatsoever
   → Excluded foods: meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, milk, cheese

USER PREFERENCES:
- Favorite cuisines: Italian, Mediterranean (prioritize these)
- Foods user dislikes: cilantro, mushrooms (avoid when possible)
- Cooking time preference: 30 minutes maximum

USER'S HEALTH JOURNEY:
- Health goal: Lose Weight
- Personal motivation: "I want to feel confident at my wedding in June"
- Weight goal: lose weight
```

#### **3. Coach Hook Integration** (`hooks/useCoachChat.ts`)
- ✅ Now uses `buildEnhancedCoachSystemPrompt()` with full profile context
- ✅ Passes complete user profile to AI
- ✅ Safety warnings appear before every AI response

---

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Recipe Chef** ✓

#### **4. Recipe Chef Prompt** (`utils/recipeChefPrompt.ts`)
**Completely Rewritten** from 9 lines to 60 lines:

**Old Prompt:**
```
You are a helpful sous-chef for this ONE recipe.
Focus on: substitutions, conversions...
```

**New Enhanced Prompt:**
```
You are Nosh's Kitchen Companion...

CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:
🚨 CRITICAL: User is allergic to: eggs
   → NEVER recommend foods containing these allergens
🚨 DIETARY RESTRICTION: Vegetarian
   → No meat or fish, but dairy and eggs are okay

USER PREFERENCES:
- User dislikes: cilantro
- Preferred cuisines: Italian, Mediterranean
- Cooking time preference: 30 minutes max

SUBSTITUTION RULES:
1. IF recipe contains user allergens → proactively suggest safe alternatives
2. IF dietary restriction conflicts → offer compliant swaps
3. Prefer ingredients from user's favorite cuisines
4. Avoid suggesting disliked ingredients
```

#### **5. Recipe Context Builder** (`utils/recipe/contextBuilder.ts`)
**Enhanced** `buildRecipeSystemPrompt()`:

**New Feature: Automatic Safety Analysis**
- ✅ Scans recipe ingredients for allergens
- ✅ Checks for dietary restriction violations
- ✅ Adds prominent warnings to AI prompt

**Example Output:**
```
CURRENT RECIPE:
TITLE: Shrimp Pasta
INGREDIENTS:
- 1 lb shrimp
- 2 cups pasta
...

SAFETY ALERTS FOR THIS RECIPE:
⚠️ CONTAINS SHELLFISH - user is allergic!
→ Proactively suggest safe substitutes in your responses
```

#### **6. Recipe Chat Hook** (`hooks/useRecipeChat.ts`)
- ✅ Now loads user profile via `useUserProfile()`
- ✅ Builds AI context with `buildAIProfileContext()`
- ✅ Passes user context to `buildRecipeSystemPrompt()`
- ✅ AI automatically sees allergens and restrictions for every recipe

---

## 🔒 **Safety Features**

### **How It Works:**

**1. User Opens Recipe with Shellfish**
```typescript
// System automatically detects:
userProfile.allergies = ["shellfish", "peanuts"]
recipe.ingredients = [{ name: "shrimp", ... }]

// AI sees this prompt addition:
⚠️ CONTAINS SHELLFISH - user is allergic!
→ Proactively suggest safe substitutes
```

**2. AI Response:**
```
"⚠️ Safety Alert: This recipe contains shrimp, which you're allergic to!

Safe alternatives:
- Chicken breast (diced)
- Firm tofu (cubed)
- Chickpeas

Would you like me to adjust the recipe with one of these substitutes?"
```

### **3. Vegan User Sees Recipe with Butter**
```
SAFETY ALERTS FOR THIS RECIPE:
⚠️ Contains butter - conflicts with vegan diet
⚠️ Contains cheese - conflicts with vegan diet

AI Response: "I notice this recipe has butter and cheese, which aren't 
vegan. Let's swap them! Use olive oil instead of butter and nutritional 
yeast or cashew cream for the cheese..."
```

*(User is allergic to shellfish and vegan)*

### **After Enhancement:**
**User:** "What should I cook for dinner?"
**AI:** "Since you follow a vegan diet and love Italian cuisine, how about a creamy tomato pasta with chickpeas? It's packed with protein, ready in 25 minutes (under your 30-min preference), and completely plant-based. Would you like the recipe?"

---

### **Before (Recipe Chat):**
**User:** "Can I substitute an ingredient?"
**AI:** "Sure! Which ingredient would you like to substitute?"

### **After (Recipe Chat):**

Safe substitutes for eggs in baking:
- Flax egg: 1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp water
- Applesauce: ¼ cup per egg
- Aquafaba: 3 tbsp per egg

Which would you prefer? The flax egg will give the best texture here."
