# Enhanced User Profile System Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive user profile system for NutriAI that enhances user personalization and AI integration across the app.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure
- **Extended User Types** (`types/index.ts`):
  - Added `EnhancedUserProfile` interface with detailed user information
  - Includes personal details (age, height, weight, activity level)
  - Dietary restrictions and allergies
  - Health goals and nutrition targets
  - Cooking preferences and skill level

### 2. User Profile Store (`hooks/useEnhancedUserProfile.ts`)
- Centralized user data management using React hooks pattern
- AsyncStorage persistence for offline access
- Methods for updating different profile sections:
  - `setPersonalInfo()` - Basic personal information
  - `setDietaryPreferences()` - Restrictions, allergies, preferences
  - `setHealthGoals()` - Goals and nutrition targets
  - `setCookingPreferences()` - Skill level and cooking preferences

### 3. AI Integration Enhancement
- **User-Aware AI Context** (`utils/userAwareAiContext.ts`):
  - `createUserAwareSystemPrompt()` - Builds personalized system prompts
  - `filterRecipesByProfile()` - Filters recipes based on user restrictions
  - Critical allergy safety warnings for AI responses

- **Enhanced Recipe Chat** (`hooks/useRecipeChat.ts`):
  - Integrated user profile context into recipe discussions
  - AI now considers dietary restrictions, allergies, and preferences
  - Personalized cooking advice based on skill level and goals

### 4. Comprehensive Profile UI

#### Main Profile Screen (`components/profile/EnhancedProfileScreen.tsx`)
- Modern, organized interface with overview and detailed sections
- Statistics cards showing goals, restrictions, and skill level
- Quick action cards for navigating to different sections

#### Profile Sections
- **Personal Info Section** (`components/profile/PersonalInfoSection.tsx`):
  - Basic information: name, age, height, weight, gender
  - Activity level selection
  - Form validation and error handling

- **Dietary Preferences Section** (`components/profile/DietaryPreferencesSection.tsx`):
  - Dietary restriction checkboxes (vegetarian, vegan, keto, etc.)
  - Allergy management with safety warnings
  - Disliked foods and preferred cuisines
  - Tag-based interface for easy management

- **Health Goals Section** (`components/profile/HealthGoalsSection.tsx`):
  - Multiple health goal selection (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.)
  - Target weight setting
  - Daily nutrition targets (calories, protein, carbs, fats)

- **Cooking Preferences Section** (`components/profile/CookingPreferencesSection.tsx`):
  - Cooking skill level assessment
  - Maximum cooking time preferences
  - Preferred meal types with custom additions
  - Tag-based meal type management

### 5. Profile Integration
- **Main Profile Tab** (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`):
  - Added toggle to use enhanced profile screen
  - Seamless integration with existing profile functionality

## Key Features

### ✅ User Personalization
- **Comprehensive Profile Data**: Detailed user information for AI personalization
- **Safety First**: Critical allergy warnings throughout the system
- **Flexible Preferences**: Easy-to-update preferences and restrictions
- **Goal-Oriented**: Health and nutrition goal integration

### ✅ AI Integration
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI considers user profile in all interactions
- **Safety Filtering**: Never suggests ingredients users are allergic to
- **Personalized Advice**: Recommendations based on goals and preferences
- **Smart Recipe Filtering**: Automatically filters inappropriate recipes

### ✅ User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Clean, organized interface with consistent design
- **Easy Navigation**: Intuitive section-based organization
- **Form Validation**: Proper error handling and user feedback
- **Persistent Storage**: Data saved locally with AsyncStorage

### ✅ Cross-App Sync
- **Recipe Integration**: Profile data available in recipe discussions
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Ready for integration with meal planning
- **Inventory Awareness**: Can be extended to consider user preferences in inventory suggestions

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **User Input** → Profile sections collect user preferences
2. **Storage** → Data persisted to AsyncStorage (ready for Supabase sync)
3. **AI Integration** → Profile context injected into AI system prompts
4. **Response Filtering** → AI responses filtered for safety and relevance

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript integration with proper type definitions
- Enum-based restriction and preference selections
- Strong typing for all profile data structures

### Extensibility
- Modular section design for easy additions
- Prepared for Supabase backend integration
- Hook-based architecture for reusability

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to Profile tab
2. Fill out personal information, dietary preferences, health goals, and cooking preferences
3. AI throughout the app will now provide personalized, safe recommendations
4. Update preferences anytime as needs change

### For Development
```typescript
// Use profile data in any component
const { profile, updateProfile } = useUserProfileStore();

// Get user-aware AI context
const prompt = createUserAwareSystemPrompt(profile, inventory, recipes);

// Filter recipes by user profile
const safeRecipes = filterRecipesByProfile(recipes, profile);
```

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Supabase backend synchronization
- [ ] Social features (sharing preferences)
- [ ] Advanced nutrition tracking integration
- [ ] Recipe recommendation engine
- [ ] Progress tracking and goal achievement
- [ ] Meal plan generation based on preferences

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `hooks/useEnhancedUserProfile.ts` - Profile data management
- `utils/userAwareAiContext.ts` - AI context integration
- `components/profile/EnhancedProfileScreen.tsx` - Main profile interface
- `components/profile/PersonalInfoSection.tsx` - Personal information form
- `components/profile/DietaryPreferencesSection.tsx` - Dietary preferences management
- `components/profile/HealthGoalsSection.tsx` - Health goals and targets
- `components/profile/CookingPreferencesSection.tsx` - Cooking preferences

### Modified Files
- `types/index.ts` - Added enhanced profile types
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added enhanced profile toggle
