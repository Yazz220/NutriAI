# Recent Changes Summary

## 1. ✅ Disabled Ingredient Icon Generation

**File:** `components/common/IngredientIcon.tsx`

- Commented out all icon generation and fetching logic
- Component now always shows the placeholder SVG
- No API calls to Supabase for icon generation
- Ready to re-enable when style is finalized

**To Re-enable:**
- Uncomment the code in `IngredientIcon.tsx`
- The component will automatically resume fetching/generating icons

## 2. ✅ Fixed Duplicate Shopping List Items

**File:** `components/recipe-detail/RecipeDetail.tsx`

**Problem:** When adding missing ingredients from multiple recipes, the same ingredient (e.g., "salt") would be added multiple times to the shopping list.

**Solution:** Added duplicate check before adding items:
```typescript
// Check if item already exists in shopping list (case-insensitive)
const exists = shoppingList.some((item: any) => 
  item.name.toLowerCase().trim() === m.name.toLowerCase().trim()
);
if (!exists) {
  await addItem({...});
  added++;
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Items are compared case-insensitively ("Salt" = "salt" = "SALT")
- Whitespace is trimmed before comparison
- Only new items are added to the shopping list
- Alert shows accurate count of items actually added

## 3. ✅ Removed Quantity Display from Inventory

**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Problem:** Inventory items showed "1 pcs" or "1 pack" even though the app only tracks present/not present.

**Solution:** 
- Removed quantity/unit display from inventory items
- Replaced with category display instead
- Added `categoryText` style for consistent formatting

**Before:**
```
Item Name
1 pcs
```

**After:**
```
Item Name
Vegetables
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner UI aligned with app's present/not-present model
- Shows more useful information (category)
- Removes confusing quantity information

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify ingredient icons show placeholder SVG only
- [ ] Add same ingredient from two different recipes → should only appear once in shopping list
- [ ] Check inventory items show category instead of "1 pcs"
- [ ] Confirm shopping list still works correctly
- [ ] Test adding items to inventory
